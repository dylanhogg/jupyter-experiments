OSX System
    Install the headers files first to avoid GDAL fail.
    GDAL will fail installing if expected version of the dependence is not present in the system.
    % brew install gdal --HEAD

    Now install GDAL
    % brew install gdal

    To be sure that GDAL is installed in your system, just type:
    % /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gdal/3.4.3_1/bin/gdal-config --version
    3.4.3
    % /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gdal/3.4.3_1/bin/gdalinfo --version
    GDAL 3.4.3, released 2022/04/22

Python
    Ensure you pip install the corresponding version, e.g. GDAL==3.4.3 in requirements.txt

Jupyter etc
    Set env vars on launch (maybe not required?):
    export GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/gdal/lib/libgdal.dylib
    export GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/geos/lib/libgeos_c.dylib
